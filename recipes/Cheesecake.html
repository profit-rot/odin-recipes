        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract and salt and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add each of the eggs, lightly beaten, and one at a time, into the mixture. You shouldn't add the next egg until the one before it is well mixed into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl, to ake sure all the contents are mixed evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into graham cracker crust.</li>
